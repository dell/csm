# v1.8.0 

## Changelog since v1.7.1 

## Known Issues

### CSI PowerFlex, CSI PowerStore, CSI Unity XT: Not able to create ephemeral pods in OpenShift 4.13

Ephemeral pod is not being created in OpenShift 4.13 and is failing with the error "error when creating pod: the pod uses an inline volume provided by CSIDriver csi-powerstore.dellemc.com, and the namespace has a pod security enforcement level that is lower than privileged." This is seen in CSI PowerFlex, CSI PowerStore and CSI Unity XT drivers.

This issue occurs because OpenShift 4.13 introduced the CSI Volume Admission plugin to restrict the use of a CSI driver capable of provisioning CSI ephemeral volumes during pod admission (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/storage/container_storage_interface/ephemeral-storage-csi-inline.html). Therefore, an additional label "security.openshift.io/csi-ephemeral-volume-profile" needs to be added to the CSIDriver object to support inline ephemeral volumes.

### CSI PowerStore: In OpenShift 4.13, root user is not allowed to perform write operations on NFS shares when root squashing is enabled

In OpenShift 4.13, the root user is not allowed to perform write operations on NFS shares, when root squashing is enabled.

The workaround for this issue is to disable root squashing by setting allowRoot: "true" in the NFS storage class.

### CSI Drivers: Volume limit for pending PVCs is not obeyed if the volume limit is exhausted and the CSI Driver restarts

If the volume limit is exhausted and there are pending pods and PVCs due to exceed max volume count, the pending PVCs will be bound to PVs and the pending pods will be scheduled to nodes when the driver pods are restarted. This is seen in CSI PowerFlex, CSI PowerMax, CSI PowerScale, CSI PowerStore and CSI Unity XT drivers.

It is advised not to have any pending pods or PVCs once the volume limit per node is exhausted on a CSI Driver. There is an open issue reported with kubenetes at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/95911 with the same behavior.

## Changes by Kind 

### Deprecation
