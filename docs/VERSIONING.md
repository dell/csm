# Versioning

Artifacts published must belong to one of the following categories:
  * "Releases", i.e. artifacts that have versions that follow the `x.y.z` format,
    where `x` is called "major version", `y` is called "minor version"
    and `z` is called "patch version".
  * "Prereleases", i.e. artifacts that have versions that follow the `x.y.z-suffix` format,
    where `x`, `y` and `z` are called the same as above, and `suffix` is
    an arbitrary suffix created by a human or generated by a tool.

## Major releases

"Major releases" are artifacts published as `x.0.0`:
  * An artifact must be released as `x.0.0` if and only if
    the difference between the current code and the code that
    has been published as `{x-1}.0.0`contains changes to:
    - Any changes that change the behaviour of existing infrastructure
    - Any changes that prevents you to deploy over and existing stack
    - Any CLI command being removed or changed
    - `{x+1}.0.0` is strongly encouraged to be backward compatible with `x.y.z` modulo deprecation warnings:
        * It is desirable to compilable against `x.y.z` to be compilable against `{x+1}.0.0` modulo deprecation warnings.
        * It is desirable to linkable against `x.y.z` to be linkable with `{x+1}.0.0`.

 
## Minor releases

"Minor releases" are artifacts published as `x.y.0`:
  * An artifact must be released as `x.y.0` if and only if
    the difference between the current code and the code
    that has been published as `x.0.0`, changes to `x.{y+1}.0` must be backward compatible with `x.y.0`:
    * It is desirable to compilable against `x.y.0` must be compilable against `x.{y+1}.z` without deprecation warnings.
    * It is desirable to linkable against `x.y.0` must be linkable against `x.{y+1}.z`.

## Patch releases

"Patch releases" are artifacts published as `x.y.z`:
  * An artifact must be released as `x.y.z` if and only if
    the difference between the current code and the code
    that has been published as `x.y.0`.
  * A release only containing backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Prereleases

"Prereleases" are artifacts published as `x.y.z-suffix`:
  * An artifact may be published as `x.y.z-suffix` if and only if:
      1) There exists an `x.y.z` release, and
      2) There exist neither `{x+1}.0.0`, nor `x.{y+1}.0`, nor `x.y.{z+1}` releases.
      3) `suffix` is in compliance with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
      4) `suffix` does not equal `SNAPSHOT`.
