# v1.11.0 

## Changelog since v1.10.2 

## Known Issues 

Controller publish is taking too long to complete/ Health monitoring is causing the Unity array to panic by opening multiple sessions. There are error messages in the log `context deadline exceeded`, when health monitoring is enabled. As a workaround, disable volume health monitoring on the node and keep it only at the controller level. Refer [here](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/csidriver/features/unity/#volume-health-monitoring) for more information about enabling/disabling volume health monitoring.
