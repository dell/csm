# v1.7.0 

## Changelog since v1.6.1 

## Known Issues

### CSI Unity XT driver does not verify iSCSI initiators on the array correctly when iSCSI initiator names are not in lowercase 

After any node reboot, the CSI Unity XT driver pod on that rebooted node goes into a failed state as driver fails to find the iSCSI initiator on the array. The work around is to rename host iSCSI initiators to lowercase and reboot the respective worker node. The CSI Unity XT driver pod will spin off successfully. Example: Rename "iqn.2000-11.com.DEMOWORKERNODE01:1a234b56cd78" to "iqn.2000-11.com.demoworkernode01:1a234b56cd78" in lowercase. 

### CSI Powerstore driver node pods enter CrashLoopBackOff state and provisioning fails

When driver node pods enter CrashLoopBackOff and PVC remains in pending state with one of the following events:
  1. failed to provision volume with StorageClass `<storage-class-name>`: error generating accessibility requirements: no available topology found
  2. waiting for a volume to be created, either by external provisioner "csi-powerstore.dellemc.com" or manually created by system administrator. 

The workaround is to check whether all array details present in the secret file are valid and remove any invalid entries if present. Redeploy the driver.

## Changes by Kind 

#### Deprecation

- CSM for PowerMax linked Proxy mode for [CSI reverse proxy is no longer actively maintained or supported](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/csm-docs/docs/csidriver/release/powermax/). It will be deprecated in CSM 1.9. It is highly recommended that you use stand alone mode going forward.
