# v1.9.3

## Changelog since v1.9.2

## Known Issues

- The status field of a csm object as deployed by CSM Operator may, in limited cases, display an incorrect status for a deployment. As a workaround, the health of the deployment can be determined by checking the health of the pods.
- When CSM Operator creates a deployment that includes secrets (e.g., application-mobility, observability, cert-manager, velero), these secrets are not deleted on uninstall and will be left behind. For example, the `karavi-topology-tls`, `otel-collector-tls`, and `cert-manager-webhook-ca` secrets will not be deleted. This should not cause any issues on the system, but all secrets present on the cluster can be found with `kubectl get secrets -A`, and any unwanted secrets can be deleted with `kubectl delete secret -n <secret-namespace> <secret-name>`

## Changes by Kind

### Features 

- Automatically create certificates when deploying observability with csm-operator. ([#1158](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1158))

### Bugs
- CSM object stays in success state when all CSI Powerflex pods are failing due to bad secret credentials. ([#1156](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1156))
- If Authorization Proxy Server is installed in an alternate namespace by CSM Operator, the deployment fails. ([#1157](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1157))
- CSM status is not always accurate when Observability is deployed by CSM Operator without all components enabled. ([#1159](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1159))
- CSI driver changes to facilitate SDC brownfield deployments. ([#1152](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1152))
- CSM object occasionally stays in failed state when app-mobility is successfully deployed with csm-operator. ([#1171](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1171))

# v1.9.2

## Changelog since v1.9.1

## Known Issues

- The status field of a csm object as deployed by CSM Operator may, in limited cases, display an incorrect status for a deployment. As a workaround, the health of the deployment can be determined by checking the health of the pods.
- The status calculation done for the csm object associated with the Authorization Proxy Server when deployed with CSM Operator assumes that the proxy server will be deployed in the "authorization" namespace. If a different namespace is used, the status will stay in the failed state, even though the deployment is healthy. As a workaround, we recommend using the "authorization" namespace for the proxy server. If this is not possible, the health of the deployment can be verified by checking the status of all the pods rather than by checking the status field.
- When CSM Operator creates a deployment that includes secrets (e.g., application-mobility, observability, cert-manager, velero), these secrets are not deleted on uninstall and will be left behind. For example, the `karavi-topology-tls`, `otel-collector-tls`, and `cert-manager-webhook-ca` secrets will not be deleted. This should not cause any issues on the system, but all secrets present on the cluster can be found with `kubectl get secrets -A`, and any unwanted secrets can be deleted with `kubectl delete secret -n <secret-namespace> <secret-name>`
- When PowerFlex CSI driver is deployed on a host that has SDC already installed or on a host that does not support automatic SDC installation (non CoreOS, non RHEL), the SDC container is unable to detect existing scini driver. As a result, the powerflex-node pod is stuck in `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` state.

## Changes by Kind

### Bugs

- CSM Operator doesn't apply fSGroupPolicy value to CSIDriver Object. ([#1103](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1103))
- CSM Operator does not calculate status correctly when a driver is deployed by itself. ([#1130](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1130))
- CSM Operator does not calculate status correctly when application-mobility is deployed by itself. ([#1133](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1133))
- CSM Operator intermittently does not calculate status correctly when deploying a driver. ([#1137](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1137))
- CSM Operator does not calculate status correctly when deploying the authorization proxy server. ([#1143](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1143))
- CSM Operator does not calculate status correctly when deploying observability with csi-powerscale. ([#1146](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1146))
- CSM Operator labels csm objects with CSMVersion 1.8.0, an old version. ([#1147](https://github.com/dell/csm/issues/1147))

# v1.9.1

## Changelog since v1.9.0

## Known Issues 

- For CSM Operator released in CSM v1.9.1, a plain driver install (no modules) will always be marked as failed in the CSM status even when it succeeds. As a workaround, the driver deployment is still usable as long as all the pods are running/healthy.
- For CSM Operator released in CSM v1.9.1, a standalone install of application-mobility (not as a module under the driver CSM) will always be marked as failed in the CSM status, even when it succeeds. This is because the operator is looking for the wrong daemonset label to confirm the deployment. As a workaround, the module is still usable as long as all the pods are running/healthy.
- For CSM Operator released in CSM v1.9.1, a driver install will rarely (~2% of the time) have a csm object stuck in a failed state for over an hour even though the deployment succeeds. This is due to a race condition in the status update logic. As a workaround, the driver is still usable as long as all the pods are running/healthy.
- For CSM Operator released in CSM v1.9.1, the authorization proxy server csm object status will always be failed, even when it succeeds. This is because the operator is looking for a daemonset status when the authorization proxy server deployment does not have a daemonset. As a workaround, the module is still usable as long as all the pods are running/healthy.
- For CSM Operator released in CSM v1.9.1, an install of csi-powerscale with observability will always be marked as failed in the csm object status, even when it succeeds. This is because the operator is looking for a legacy name of isilon in the status check. As a workaround, the module is still usable as long as all the pods are running/healthy.
- For csm objects created by the CSM Operator, the CSMVersion label value is v1.8.0 when it should be v1.9.1. As a workaround, the CSM version can be double-checked by checking the operator version -- v1.4.1 operator corresponds to CSM v1.9.1.
- The status field of a csm object as deployed by CSM Operator may, in limited cases, display an incorrect status for a deployment. As a workaround, the health of the deployment can be determined by checking the health of the pods.
- When PowerFlex CSI driver is deployed on a host that has SDC already installed or on a host that does not support automatic SDC installation (non CoreOS, non RHEL), the SDC container is unable to detect existing scini driver. As a result, the powerflex-node pod is stuck in `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` state.

# v1.9.0 

## Changelog since v1.8.0 

## Known Issues 

- For CSM PowerMax, automatic SRDF group creation is failing with "Unable to get Remote Port on SAN for Auto SRDF" on PowerMax 10.1 arrays. As a workaround, create the SRDF Group and add it to the storage class.
- For CSM Operator released in CSM v1.9.0, a driver install will rarely (~2% of the time) have a csm object stuck in a failed state for over an hour even though the deployment succeeds. This is due to a race condition in the status update logic.
- For csm objects created by the CSM Operator, the CSMVersion label value is v1.8.0 when it should be v1.9.0. As a workaround, the CSM version can be double-checked by checking the operator version -- v1.4.0 operator corresponds to CSM v1.9.0.

### Deprecation 

- The Dell CSI Operator is no longer actively maintained or supported. Dell CSI Operator has been replaced with [Dell CSM Operator](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/deployment/csmoperator/). If you are currently using Dell CSI Operator, refer to the [operator migration documentation](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/csidriver/installation/operator/operator_migration/) to migrate from Dell CSI Operator to Dell CSM Operator.
- CSM for PowerMax linked Proxy mode for [CSI reverse proxy is no longer actively maintained or supported](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/csidriver/release/powermax/). It will be deprecated in CSM 1.9. It is highly recommended that you use stand alone mode going forward.
- The CSM Authorization RPM will be deprecated in a future release. It is highly recommended that you use CSM Authorization [Helm deployment](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/authorization/deployment/helm/) or [CSM Operator](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/authorization/deployment/operator/) going forward.
