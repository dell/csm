#! "volumeNamePrefix" defines a string prepended to each volume created by the CSI driver.
volumeNamePrefix: csivol

#! Represents number of certificate secrets, which user is going to create for ssl authentication. (isilon-cert-0..isilon-cert-n)
#! Minimum value should be 1
certSecretCount: 1

#! "snapNamePrefix" defines a string prepended to each snapshot registered by the CSI driver.
snapNamePrefix: csi-snap

#! The default pull policy is IfNotPresent which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image
#! if it already exists. If you would like to always force a pull, use "Always"
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

#! Indicates whether debug level logs should be logged
enableDebug: "true"

#! "defaultFsType" is used to set the default FS type which will be used
#! for mount volumes if FsType is not specified in the storage class
defaultFsType: ext4

#! Time interval to add node info to array. Default 15 minutes. Minimum value should be 1.
#! If your specifies 0, then time is set to default value.
#! syncNodeInfoInterval has been deprecated and will be removed from use in values.yaml in a future release.
#! This can be now configured from secret.json/secret.yaml.
#! The value from secret can be loaded dynamically by the driver without requiring a re-installation and has higher precedence.
syncNodeInfoInterval: "15"

#! Flag to enable sharing of volumes across multiple pods within the same node in RWO access mode.
#! Setting allowRWOMultiPodAccess to "true" will allow multiple pods on the same node
#! to access the same RWO volume. This behavior conflicts with the CSI specification version 1.3
#! NodePublishVolume descrition that requires an error to be returned in this case.
#! However some other CSI drivers support this behavior and some customers desire this behavior.
#! Kubernetes could make a change at their discretion that would preclude our ability to support this option.
#! Customers use this option at their own risk.
