# Maintainer Guidelines

As a Maintainer of this project you have the responsibility of keeping true to the vision of the project with unprecedented quality. Being part of this group is a privilege that requires dedication and time to attend to the daily activities that are associated with the maintenance of this project.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Most Maintainers started as Contributors that have demonstrated their commitment to the success of the project. Contributors wishing to become Maintainers, must demonstrate commitment to the success of the project by contributing code, reviewing others' work, and triaging issues on a regular basis for at least three months.

The contributions alone don't make you a Maintainer. You need to earn the trust of the current Maintainers and other project Contributors, that your decisions and actions are in the best interest of the project.

Periodically, the existing Maintainers curate a list of Contributors who have shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. It is from this list that Maintainer candidates are selected.

After a candidate is selected, the existing Maintainers discuss the candidate over the next 5 business days, provide feedback, and vote. At least 75% of the current Maintainers must vote in the affirmative for a candidate to be moved to the role of Maintainer.

If a candidate is approved, a Maintainer contacts the candidate to invite them to open a pull request that adds the contributor to the MAINTAINERS file. The candidate becomes a Maintainer once the pull request is merged.

## Maintainer Policies

* Lead by example
* Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the guidelines in the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Committer](COMMITTER_GUIDE.md) guides
* Promote a friendly and collaborative environment within our community
* Be actively engaged in discussions, answering questions, updating defects, and reviewing pull requests
* Criticize code, not people. Ideally, tell the contributor a better way to do what they need.
* Clearly mark optional suggestions as such. Best practice, start your comment with *At your option: …*

## Project Decision Making

All project decisions should contribute to successfully executing on the project roadmap. Project milestones are established for each release.
